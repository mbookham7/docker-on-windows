# Docker on Windows

This is all the source code for the samples in my book [Docker on Windows](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Docker-Windows-Elton-Stoneman-ebook/dp/B0711Y4J9K), published by Packt.

Every Dockerfile is also available on Docker Hub at the [dockeronwindows](https://hub.docker.com/r/dockeronwindows/) organization.

It's a comprehensive look at running Docker on Windows, covering everything from 101 to production over 12 chapters.

## Weekly Dockerfile

I've also got a blog series describing all the Dockerfiles in detail: [Weekly Windows Dockerfiles](https://blog.sixeyed.com/tag/weekly-dockerfile/)

## The Missing Preface

Somewhere between the author's laptop, the publisher's content system and the printing press, the preface I wrote didn't make it into the final book. You can read it [here](preface.md).
